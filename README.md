## Description

Nest-on-Edge is set of libraries to run the popular Nest.js framework for edge environments like Cloudflare Workers

<p>Under the hood, Nest on Edge makes use of <a href="https://hono.dev/" target="_blank">Hone</a>, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.</p>

## Philosophy

<p>In recent years, thanks to Node.js, JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications, giving rise to awesome projects like <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react" target="_blank">React</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank">Vue</a> which improve developer productivity and enable the construction of fast, testable, extensible frontend applications. However, on the server-side, while there are a lot of superb libraries, helpers and tools for Node, none of them effectively solve the main problem - the architecture.</p>
<p>Nest aims to provide an application architecture out of the box which allows for effortless creation of highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.</p>
